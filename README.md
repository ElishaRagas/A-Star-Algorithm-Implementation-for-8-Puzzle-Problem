# A* Implemented on the 8 Puzzle Problem

This is my simple implementation of the A* Algorithm to solve the 8 Puzzle Problem. I made in order to have a better understanding of how the A* algorithm works and also because this was a project at school. LOL, XD

## C++
I wrote this on c++, so everything is on command line only. To compile it just type
To compile:
```
g++ A-Star_Implementation.cpp -o A-Star_Implementation
```

## Improvements
The current program still has a lot of problem, and some cases where it cant solve the puzzle. I'm pretty sure there are a lot of optimization possible but I still dont know, would really appreciate some help, ^_^. I'm also thinking maybe I should rewrite it in Java to have an interface or maybe in Unity to try some game development stuff.

## Experience
Overall I had fun making this program, I'm still a beginner at coding and I really like seeing how algorithms work. I would probably enjoy making future implementations using the A* Algorithm.
